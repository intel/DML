Library Testing
###############

The Intel速 Data Mover Library (Intel速 DML) is distributed with
its own test system based on the GoogleTest framework.
You can find various types of tests in ``<install_dir>/bin/`` folder.

.. attention::

    Intel DML test framework development is still in progress.
    Expect to see more coverage and refactoring in future releases.

Functional Tests
================

Functional validation of Intel DML could be done with different types of tests provided.

Low-Level API (or Job API) and core unit tests (comparing internal optimized code path with some
reference code path) include:

- Algorithmic tests (``ta_*``) serve to find errors that reflect logic
  errors in data processing on correct data.
- Bad argument tests (``tb_*``) verify the code path for invalid arguments.

Such tests are combined together into ``tests`` and ``tests_mt`` (multithreaded version) executables.
In order to use those, following commands could be used:

.. code-block:: shell

    ./tests --path=sw

.. code-block:: shell

    ./tests_mt --path=sw --nthreads=2

Full list of parameters is available via ``./<executable_name> --help``.

Additional High-Level API and Low-Level API tests are compiled into
``dml_test_functional_<api>_<path>_<operation>``, where ``api=c`` refers to
Low-Level Job API and ``api=cpp`` refers to High-Level API tests,
``<path>`` could be one of ``sw`` (DML_PATH_SW for Low-Level API or dml::software for High-Level API, used for host execution),
``hw`` (DML_PATH_HW or hardware, for accelerator offloading), or auto (DML_PATH_AUTO or dml::automatic).

In order to execute those, use the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    ./dml_test_functional_<api>_<path>_<operation>

.. attention::

   Hardware Path requires first configuring Intel速 Data Streaming Accelerator (Intel速 DSA).
   See :ref:`Accelerator Configuration <accelerator_configuration_reference_link>`.


Fuzz Tests
==========

Fuzz testing is an automated software testing technique that attempts to
find hackable software bugs by randomly feeding invalid and unexpected
inputs and data into a computer program in order to find coding errors
and security loopholes.

Intel DML fuzz testing is based on `LibFuzzer
tool <https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html>`__ and requires a separate
build using the Clang compiler (version 12.0.1 or higher) with the
``-DDML_BUILD_FUZZ_TESTS=ON`` CMake option.

Fuzz tests are not installed into ``<install_dir>/bin/`` but available
in:

- ``<dml_library>/build/tools/tests/fuzzing/high-level-api/``

To run fuzz tests, specify the maximum run time using ``-max_total_time=<seconds>``,
for example:

.. code:: shell

   <dml_library>/build/tools/tests/fuzzing/high-level-api/mem_move -max_total_time=15
